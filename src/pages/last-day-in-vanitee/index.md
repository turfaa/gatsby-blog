Today is my last day having an internship at [Vanitee](https://www.vanitee.com)
in Singapore. I didn't have any task left since the afternoon. That proud
moment when you can say, "I don't have anything to do." in the daily stand up
lol.

Recognizing my _gabutness_, I planned to execute one thing from my to-do
list: migrating this blog to [Gatsbyjs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/).

I did some research to decide which starter kit I should use. And in the end,
I choose [Gatsby Starter Blog](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog).
Haha. Simple is better.

And... here we go.

Hope I can be more productive in writing after this. (Actually I'm being
pessimistic about it. Just see the date of the other posts. :(  )
